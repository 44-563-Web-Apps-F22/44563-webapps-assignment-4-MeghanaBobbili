    <h4>ACT I</h4>
        <p1 class="direction">[Scene—The ruins of the The Temple of the Gods, on summit of
        Mount Olympus.  Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with
        ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen
        columns on the stage. Three broken pillars 2 R.E.  At the back of
        stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This
        should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to
        ascend and descend.  In the distance are the summits of adjacent
        mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which
        clears presently.  Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
        duty as fatigued with their night's work]</p1>

      <h4 class="DIANA">DIA</h4><p class="speech">Stealing. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.</p>

  <h4 class="MERCURY">MER</h4><p>Oh, as the god of thieves I must do something to justify my
  position.</p>

  <h4 class="DIAandAP">DIA and AP</h4><p1 class="direction">[contemptuously]</p1><p class="speech">Your position.</p>

  <h4 class="MERCURY">MER</h4><p class="speech">Oh, I know it's nothing to boast of even on earth.  Up here,
  it's simply contemptible.  Now that you gods are too old for your
  work, you've made me the miserable drudge of Olympus—groom,
  valet, postman, butler, commissionaire, maid of all work, parish
  beadle, and original dustman.</p>

  <h4 class="APOLLO">AP</h4><p class="speech">Your Christmas boxes ought to be something considerable.</p>

  <h4 class="MERCURY">MER</h4><p class="speech">They ought to be but they're not.  I'm treated abominably.
  I make everybody and I'm nobody.  I go everywhere and I'm
  nowhere.  I do everything and I'm nothing.  I've made thunder for
  Jupiter, odes for Apollo, battles for Mars, and love for Venus.
  I've married couples for Humen and six weeks afterwards, I've
  divorced them for Cupid, and in return I get all the kicks while
  they pocket the halfpence. And in compensation for robbing me of
  the halfpence in question, what have they done for me.</p>

  <h4 class="APOLLO">AP</h4><p class="speech">they've—ha.ha.ha. they've made you the god of thieves.</p>

  <h4 class="MERCURY">MER</h4><p class="speech">Very self denying of them.  There isn't one of them who
  hasn't a better claim to the distinction than I have.</p>

       <p class="song">Oh, I'm the celestial drudge,
       For morning to night I must stop at it.
       On errands all day I must trudge,
       And stick to my work til I drop at it.
       In summer I get up at one.
       (As a good-natured donkey I'm ranked for it.)
       then I go and I light up the sun.
       And Phoebus Apollo gets thanked for it.
       Well, well, it's the way of the world.
       And will be through all its futurity.
       Though noodles are baroned and earled,
       There's nothing for clever obscurity.

       I'm the slave of the Gods, neck and heels,
       And I'm bound to obey, though I rate at 'em.
       And I not only order their meals,
       But I cook 'em and serve'em and wait at 'em.
       Then I make all their nectar, I do.
       (What a terrible liquor to rack us is.)
       And whenever I mix them a brew,
       Why all the thanksgivings are Bacchus's.
       Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc.....

       The reading and writing I teach.
       And spelling-books many I've edited.
       And for bringing those arts within reach,
       That donkey Minerva gets credited.
       Then I scrape at the stars with a knife,
       And plate-powder the moon (on the days for it).
       And I hear all the world and his wife
       Awarding Diana the praise for it.
       Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc....</p>

  <p1 class="direction">[After song—very loud and majestic music is heard]</p1>

  <h4 class="DIAandMER">DIA and MER</h4><p1 class="direction">[looking off]</p1><p class="speech">Why, who's this? Jupiter, by Jove.</p>

  <p1 class="direction">[Enter Jupiter, an extremely old man, very decrepit, with very
  thin straggling white beard, he wears a long braided dressing
  gown, handsomely trimmed, and a silk night-cap on his head.
  Mercury falls back respectfully as he enters.]</p1>

  <h4 class="JUPITER">JUP</h4><p class="speech">Good day, Diana.  Ah, Apollo.  Well, well, well, what's the
  matter? What's the matter?</p>

  <h4 class="DIANA">DIA</h4><p class="speech">Why that young scamp Mercury says that we do nothing, and
  leave all the duties of Olympus to him. Will you believe it, he
  actually says that our influence on earth is dropping down to
  nil.</p>

  <h4 class="JUPITER">JUP</h4><p class="speech">Well, well. Don't be hard on the lad.  To tell you the
  truth, I'm not sure that he's far wrong. Don't let it go any
  further, but, between ourselves, the sacrifices and votive
  offerings have fallen off terribly of late. Why, I can remember
  the time when people offered us human sacrifices, no mistake
  about it, human sacrifices.  Think of that.</p>

  <h4 class="DIANA">DIA</h4><p class="speech">Ah. Those good old days.</p>

  <h4 class="JUPITER">JUP</h4><p class="speech">Then it fell off to oxen, pigs, and sheep.</p>

  <h4 class="APOLLO">AP</h4><p class="speech">Well, there are worse things than oxen, pigs and sheep.</p>

  <h4 class="JUPITER">JUP</h4><p class="speech">So I've found to my cost. My dear sir, between ourselves,
  it's dropped off from one thing to another until it has
  positively dwindled down to preserved Australian beef. What do
  you think of that?</p>
